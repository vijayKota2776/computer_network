## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Download from: [Cisco NetAcad ‚Äì Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
   - Install it based on your OS (Windows/Linux/macOS).
   - You may need to create a free Cisco Networking Academy account.

2. **Clone or Download This Repository**
   - Using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/vijayKota2776/computer_network.git
     cd computer_network
     ```
   - Or click ‚ÄúCode > Download ZIP‚Äù on GitHub and extract it.

3. **Open Simulation Files**
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Go to `File > Open...` and select any `.pkt` file from the repo.

4. **Explore the Network Topology**
   - Click on network devices (routers, switches, PCs).
   - Check configuration via CLI or GUI tabs.
   - See IP addressing, protocol configuration, and topology layout.

5. **Run and Analyze Simulations**
   - Switch to **Simulation Mode** (bottom right).
   - Click ‚ÄúAdd Simple PDU‚Äù to simulate ping or service requests.
   - Observe packet flow in the Event List.
   - Diagnose errors or connectivity problems manually.

6. **Experiment and Learn**
   - Modify existing topologies or build your own.
   - Change IP addresses, add more devices, or configure routing.
   - Use this as a lab for troubleshooting and practice.
